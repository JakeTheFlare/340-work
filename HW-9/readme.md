## The work I did for this homework cycle...
- Learning how the box model in an HTML document works.
- Learning about display, layouts, and positioning elements.
- Learning about other newer things like; hidden elements, the z-index, and float & clear.

## Work Process:
- Color Scheme: There's really no specific reason why I chose the color scheme that I did.  Like I said in my previous homework assignment, I usually prefer warm color schemes, but for this one, I just thought it would be fun to change it up a bit and do a cooler color scheme.
- Font Style: I stuck with Babel Sans for my title, and Sans-Serif for my body because I just wanted to do something simple and nothing too complex for this week.
- I spent a lot of time focusing on doing my CSS and HTML layout that I didn't have any time or ideas for my main content, so I had to turn to the Lorem ipsum website.

I'm sorry to say, but I got so focused on my homework that I didn't have time to help out on any issues this week.

I really had a hard time understanding how display items work, so my navigation bar and my dropdown didn't turn out the way I had hoped that it would.  Needless to say, this wasn't really my best week of class this semester.  I am hoping that we will have more time to dive deeper into this subject before the final project.
