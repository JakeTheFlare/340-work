## The work I did for this homework cycle...
- Learning about the id and class attributes.
- Learning about the div element, that'll prove very useful for organizing things in HTML.
- Learning about iframes.
- Learning about how to use audio and videos in HTML.
- Learning about metadata.

As always I read over website's information for the week at least once before I began the assignment, then I would read them over again while doing my assignment if there is something I didn't understand or have trouble with.  And I would take breaks in between to avoid stressing out and plan out perfect times to do my work.

I had some difficulty trying to display a YouTube video at first, so I posted this issue on the website to get some help.  Luckily, I got it, [oliviacoleman](https://github.com/OliviaColeman) managed to inform me that I had to make some edits with my coding.

I learned quite a lot of new things about HTML coding this week.  I am hoping that we will dive into more about class attributes and div elements before the semester gets over.

`I did not help out with any issues this week.`
