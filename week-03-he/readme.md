## The work I did for this homework cycle...
- Understanding the basics of HTML coding (though I’d call it reviewing since I had a little bit of experience from classes I took in the past).
- Understanding how to create webpages in my repositories on the Github website.

The steps I took this week were the same as last week’s; read and follow the directions as I worked, make time to work, and take breaks in between if I ever got stressed out.

The only issue I had this week was trying to turn in my homework into my class repository (same with some of the other students).  I was trying to turn it in by via the Github Desktop, but I never figured anything out.  So I eventually took advice from [michaelmusick](https://github.com/michaelmusick) and decided to manually turn it in on the website.
```
So far, there isn’t anything in particular I learned this week that I would like to discuss further.  I mean, we’re obviously going to get more into HTML coding, one way or the other.

`The only issue I helped out with this week was helping a fellow student try to figure out why their screenshot won’t show up on their homework repo.  I told them it was because they weren’t typing in the “accurate name” of the image file in their code, believe me, it really helps to be very accurate with your coding.`
