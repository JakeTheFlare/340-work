  <h1>A Bird, came down the Walk</h1>
  <h2>by, Emily Dickinson</h2>
<p>A Bird, came down the Walk -<br />
He did not know I saw -<br />
He bit an Angle Worm in halves<br />
  And ate the fellow, raw, <br /></p>
 
<p>And then, he drank a Dew<br />
From a convenient Grass -<br />
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall<br />
  To let a Beetle pass -<br /></p>
 
<p>He glanced with rapid eyes,<br />
That hurried all abroad -<br />
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought,<br />
  He stirred his Velvet Head. - <br /></p>
 
<p>Like one in danger, Cautious,<br />
I offered him a Crumb,<br />
And he unrolled his feathers, <br />
  And rowed him softer Home -<br /></p>
 
<p>Than Oars divide the Ocean,<br />
Too silver for a seam,<br />
Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon,<br />
  Leap, plashless as they swim. <br /></p>
