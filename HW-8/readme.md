## The work I did for this homework cycle...
- Reviewing some old things about CSS styling and learning some new things as well.
- Decorated my webpage to make it more engaging for my audience.
- Edited texts in my webpage to make them more interesting to read.
- Learning to add elements to specific parts of an HTML document.
- Learned how to use new elements like; psuedo-classes and the span element.

## Work Process:
- To make the title of my fictional news-report and title of my story pop out more, I made use of elements like; font-size, text-decoration, background-color, some unique font-families, and mostly the span element.
- For my color scheme, I used a palette consisting of some tints and shades of brown and tan I found on another website.  Two main reasons were because I wanted to make the webpage look like an actual newspaper article, and because I kind of prefer warm color schemes.
- My choices for text-align, text-indent, line-height, letter-spacing, and word-spacing were all based off of what I have viewed on other newspapers for examples.
- I went to my sister's softball game this weekend, and I just thought up this idea about my own dog when I was imagining of something exciting to happen.  (These games can get pretty boring just so you know.)
- Whenever I got stuck or unsure about something, I went back to the course website to get a quick review, like I always do.

I understood how hover elements work, the only thing I had trouble with though was creating a hover element that changes to an image, like in the [example on the course website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/mart341-webDev/modules/week-8/psuedo-classes/).  I posted the issue on the homework site, though I'm pretty sure that I'm not going to get a reply until after the due date.

I helped out with one issue this week (two people having the same exact issue to be more specific).  [michealmusick](https://github.com/michaelmusick) and [gordonty](https://github.com/gordonty) were both having trouble trying to link their CSS style sheets to their HTML documents, so I shared with them an example of what I did on my project.

I thought that it was pretty interesting diving into CSS styling.  It's just so amazing how linking these kinds of documents can change a whole lot of things in one webpage.  I am hoping that we will get to review and learn more about it later on in the semester, especially the newer stuff I learned about like; psuedo-classes.
