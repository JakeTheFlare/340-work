Throughout this week, I have learned a lot about; layout design, setting background images, parallax scrolling, and the process of designing a website.

## Work Process:
- I have chosen a color palette consisting of red, black, and gray because it seemed like the appropriate colors for a website that talks all about volcanic eruptions.
- In order to make my website a little more engaging, I used the first heading to make my text appear bigger and used very exciting choices of words in my content boxes.
- I know that my page doesn't look all that interesting compared to the other student's work, but all I was trying to do for this week was to learn about multi-image parallax and figure out how it works.

## Issues:
- As I was trying to add background images to my site, for the parallax scrolling effect, my images weren't appearing at all, and I had absolutely no idea what I was doing wrong, I knew I was typing in the code right.  After I posted this issue on the GitHub site, [michaelmusick](https://github.com/michaelmusick) replied back to me, saying that I have to move my images folder into my CSS folder, and it worked.
- I also spent hours trying to figure out how to create a parallax scrolling effect, and I was kind of struggling throughout most of that time.  But after reading over numerous of examples from the class website and w3schools, over and over again, I eventually figured out the exact codes I need to type in order for that effect to work.  (These CSS files require a lot of specific details.)

I am still trying to learn about many things that I have learned recently; RWD, margin and padding, and the stuff from this week.  Rest assure though, I will still give it my all for my final website project and fully understand how everything works.
