<h2>How to Make a Reese's Peanut Butter... Cake</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (18 1/2 <a href="definition-list.html">oz.</a>) Box of Dark Chocolate Cake Mix</li>
    <li>1 1/3 <a href="definition-list.html">Cups</a> of Water</li>
    <li>1/2 <a href="definition-list.html">Cup</a> of Vegetable Oil</li>
    <li>3 Eggs</li>
    <li>2 <a href="definition-list.html">Cups</a> of Powdered Sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 <a href="definition-list.html">Cup</a> of Creamy Peanut Butter</li>
    <li>1 1/2 <a href="definition-list.html">Teaspoons</a> of Vanilla</li>
    <li>1/4 <a href="definition-list.html">Cup</a> of Milk</li>
    <li>1 (12 <a href="definition-list.html">oz.</a>) Package Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips</li>
    <li>6-8 <b>Reese's Peanut Butter Cups</b>, Chilled Then Chopped</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare cake in a 9x13 pan.  Set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>Mix peanut butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla with mixer.</li>
    <li>Add small amounts of milk until desired consistency is achieved.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep in mind that this is going to be frosting; so the thicker the better.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Spread evenly over cool caked.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>(Hint -- if cake is partially frozen, there is less “tearing” when spreading frosting.).</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Melt chocolate chips in microwave for one minute. Stir to ensure all is melted and it has a slightly "runny" consistency.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Makes it easier to spread!</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Spread this over the top of the peanut butter frosting; spoonfuls at a time. Reheat if it hardens.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the chopped peanut butter cups over the warm chocolate to ensure it sticks. Chill to set chocolate.</li>
    <li>This will be easier to cut at room temperature as the top chocolate layer will have hardened.</li>
    <li>You can bypass that difficulty by cutting thru the first layer before it sets too hard.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Not a problem really if you don't; just not as pretty if the top breaks while cutting it.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>As an alternative; you can also use a bundt cake pan. Make the peanut butter frosting a little thinner in that case so it “drips” better.</li>
    <li>Another idea would be to add the chopped peanut butter cups to the cake mix before baking.</li>
  </ol>
